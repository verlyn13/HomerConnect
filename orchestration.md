# Community Calendar Orchestration Plan

**Goal:** To manage the execution of the implementation plan efficiently, ensuring logical progression, maximizing parallelism, mitigating risks, and facilitating smooth transitions between stages.

**Tools:** Project Management Board (e.g., Trello, Jira, GitHub Projects), Communication Channel (e.g., Slack), Version Control (Git/GitHub), CI/CD Platform.

**Key Principles:**

* **Iterative Progress:** Build foundational elements first, then layer features.
* **Parallel Streams:** Identify and execute independent workstreams concurrently where possible (e.g., Frontend vs. Backend setup, User Module vs. Event Module).
* **Clear Dependencies:** Explicitly manage dependencies using the project board and communication. Blocked tasks are clearly marked.
* **Regular Checkpoints:** Formal reviews at key milestones to ensure quality and alignment before proceeding.
* **Feedback Loops:** Integrate feedback from demos, testing, and stakeholder reviews promptly.
* **Maintainability Focus:** Emphasize documentation and clear handovers throughout.

### Stage Orchestration Details

**1. Initialization Stage (Orchestration)**

* **Workflow:** Primarily parallel setup activities driven by initial decisions. Project Lead coordinates decision-making.
* **Parallelism:**
  * (INIT-01: Repo Setup), (INIT-04: Comms Setup), (INIT-06: Supabase Setup) can start immediately after initial decisions are made.
  * (INIT-02: Dev Tools Setup) involves individual developer setup, happening concurrently.
  * (INIT-03: Coding Standards) & (INIT-05: Docs Framework) depend on INIT-01 (Repo exists).
* **Critical Path:** Quick decision-making (INIT-01.1, INIT-02.1, etc.) followed by Supabase project creation (INIT-06) as it's a dependency for Stage 2.
* **Checkpoint:** End-of-stage sync meeting: Verify all team members have access to Repo, Supabase, Comms, Tools. Confirm basic repo structure (`README`, `.gitignore`, `/docs`) is in place.
* **Transition Criteria:** All INIT tasks marked as complete on the project board. Environment readiness confirmed by all team members.

**2. Foundation Stage (Orchestration)**

* **Workflow:** Split into Frontend (FE) and Backend (BE)/Database (DB) streams initially. DB design precedes implementation. Auth integration connects FE/BE.
* **Parallelism:**
  * Stream 1: (FND-01: Init FE)
  * Stream 2: (FND-02: Init BE) -> (FND-07: BE Structure Def) & (FND-08: Dockerize BE)
  * Stream 3: (FND-03: Design DB Schema) - *Can start early, potentially overlapping Stage 1.*
* **Dependencies & Sequencing:**
    1. FND-01 || FND-02 || FND-03 (Start)
    2. FND-03 (Design DB) must complete before FND-04 (Migrate DB).
    3. FND-04 (Migrate DB) & FND-05 (Supabase Auth Setup) must complete before FND-06 (FE Auth Flow). FND-05 also depends on FND-04 trigger.
    4. FND-07/FND-08 depend on FND-02.
* **Critical Path:** FND-03 (DB Design) -> FND-04 (Migrate DB) -> FND-05 (Supabase Auth Setup) -> FND-06 (FE Auth Flow). Getting the basic login/signup flow working end-to-end is key. Dockerized BE (FND-08) is also critical for consistent dev environment.
* **Checkpoints:**
  * **DB Schema Review (FND-03.7):** Mandatory team review before FND-04 starts.
  * **Basic Auth Demo:** Demonstrate user signup/login/logout via FE connecting to Supabase (End of FND-06).
  * **BE Docker Verification:** Confirm backend runs correctly via `docker-compose up` (End of FND-08).
* **Transition Criteria:** DB Schema migrated. Basic FE/BE apps running locally (FE via npm, BE via Docker). Users can successfully sign up, log in, and log out via the frontend. Backend development environment is containerized.

**3. Core Functionality Stage (Orchestration)**

* **Workflow:** Feature-driven development with multiple parallel streams. Requires coordination on API contracts between FE and BE. AI feature involves external dependencies.
* **Parallelism:**
  * Stream A (Events): CORE-01 (BE CRUD) -> CORE-02 (FE Display) & CORE-03 (FE Forms)
  * Stream B (Users): CORE-04 (BE Profile) -> CORE-05 (FE Profile)
  * Stream C (AI Input - can start after Event BE structure solidifies): CORE-07 (BE AI Logic) -> CORE-08 (BE AI Validation - **CRITICAL**) -> CORE-09 (FE Widget)
  * Stream D (Supporting Features - start once dependencies met): CORE-06 (Permissions), CORE-10 (BE Search) -> CORE-11 (FE Search), CORE-12 (RSVP), CORE-13 (Admin UI)
* **Dependencies & Sequencing:**
    1. CORE-02/03 depend heavily on CORE-01 API contract. Define early via tools like Swagger/OpenAPI or draft PRs.
    2. CORE-05 depends on CORE-04 API.
    3. CORE-07 (AI) needs the event saving logic from CORE-01. CORE-08 MUST validate CORE-07 output *before* saving. CORE-09 depends on CORE-07 endpoint.
    4. CORE-06 (Permissions) applies to CORE-01/CORE-04 endpoints. Implement progressively as endpoints stabilize.
    5. CORE-10 (Search BE) depends on CORE-01 (event data structure). CORE-11 depends on CORE-10.
    6. CORE-12 (RSVP) depends on CORE-01 (event identification).
    7. CORE-13 (Admin UI) depends on CORE-01, CORE-04, CORE-06 for data and access control.
* **Critical Path:** Likely the Event CRUD stream (CORE-01 -> CORE-02 -> CORE-03) due to its centrality. The AI stream (CORE-07 -> CORE-08 -> CORE-09) is also critical due to complexity and the validation requirement (CORE-08).
* **Checkpoints:**
  * **API Contract Reviews:** Before significant FE work begins on Events/Profiles.
  * **Event CRUD Demo:** Show creating, viewing (on calendar), updating, deleting events via UI.
  * **Profile Update Demo:** Show viewing and editing user profile via UI.
  * **AI Input PoC Demo:** Early demo showing voice capture -> backend processing -> *structured data output* (before full saving). Focus on CORE-08 validation logic review.
  * **Permissions Logic Review:** Code review of backend guards/middleware.
  * **Basic Search/RSVP Demo.**
  * **Admin UI Preview.**
* **Feedback Loops:** Internal demos of UI components (Calendar, Forms) for usability checks. Frequent internal testing of the AI input flow.
* **Transition Criteria:** MVP level functionality for Event CRUD, User Profiles, AI Input (draft creation), Search, RSVP achieved. Basic admin views exist. Permissions are enforced on key endpoints. Functionality demonstrable.

**4. Integration Stage (Orchestration)**

* **Workflow:** Focus shifts to connecting the pieces built in Stage 3. Requires close FE/BE collaboration and testing across features.
* **Parallelism:** Less parallelism here; more focused integration efforts. INT-01 (AI E2E) and INT-02 (Profile Image) can be tackled by different devs/pairs but require coordination. INT-03/INT-04 are cross-cutting.
* **Dependencies & Sequencing:**
    1. INT-01 depends on completion of CORE-08 and CORE-09.
    2. INT-02 depends on completion of CORE-05 and Supabase Storage setup (implicit in INIT-06).
    3. INT-03 (Data Flow) requires all major features to be integrated to test interactions.
    4. INT-04 (API/Error Handling) solidifies contracts used throughout CORE stage.
* **Critical Path:** INT-01 (AI End-to-End) verification. INT-03 (System-wide Data Flow) testing to catch interaction bugs.
* **Checkpoints:**
  * **Full User Journey Demos:** Demonstrate: Signup -> Login -> Create Event (Manual) -> View Calendar -> Edit Event -> RSVP -> Update Profile (w/ Image) -> Create Event (AI) -> Search -> Logout.
  * **API Error Handling Review:** Check consistency and clarity of error responses from BE and handling in FE.
* **Feedback Loops:** Internal testing sessions focusing on multi-step user flows.
* **Transition Criteria:** Key user journeys are smooth and data is consistent across the application. AI input successfully creates validated events. Profile images work. APIs are stable.

**5. User Experience (UX) Stage (Orchestration)**

* **Workflow:** Primarily frontend refinement based on functional application. Accessibility and Responsiveness require systematic effort.
* **Parallelism:**
  * UX-01 (UI Polish), UX-02 (Accessibility), UX-03 (Responsiveness) can occur largely in parallel, often tackled by FE devs specializing or rotating focus.
  * UX-04 (Workflow Opt.), UX-05 (AI UX) build upon the polished base.
* **Dependencies & Sequencing:** Depends on Stage 4 completion (stable, integrated features). Refinements build upon each other (e.g., Polish -> Accessibility checks).
* **Critical Path:** Ensuring dedicated time for UX-02 (Accessibility) and UX-03 (Responsiveness) testing and fixes across all core views and components.
* **Checkpoints:**
  * **UI Style Guide Review:** Compare UI against design mocks/guidelines.
  * **Accessibility Audit:** Run automated tools (Axe), perform manual keyboard/screen reader testing. Review results.
  * **Mobile Responsiveness Review:** Test on key device sizes/emulators/real devices.
  * **Usability Walkthrough:** Demonstrate key flows focusing on ease-of-use for target non-technical users.
* **Feedback Loops:** Solicit feedback from stakeholders/potential users on the refined UI/UX. Conduct informal usability tests if possible.
* **Transition Criteria:** UI is visually polished, consistent. Application meets WCAG 2.2 AA target. Layout adapts correctly to mobile/tablet/desktop. Key workflows feel intuitive. Feedback addressed.

**6. Testing Stage (Orchestration)**

* **Workflow:** Formal verification phase involving automated tests, UAT, performance checks, and security review, followed by bug fixing.
* **Parallelism:**
  * TEST-01 (Unit Tests) & TEST-02 (Integration Tests) augmentation.
  * TEST-03 (UAT) planning and execution.
  * TEST-04 (Performance Test) setup and execution.
  * TEST-05 (Security Audit).
  * TEST-06 (Cross-Browser Testing).
  * TEST-07 (Bug Fixing) runs continuously based on findings from all other test activities.
* **Dependencies & Sequencing:**
    1. TEST-01/02 should ideally run via CI on every commit/PR throughout development. This stage focuses on increasing coverage and robustness.
    2. TEST-03 (UAT) requires a stable, UX-refined build (End of Stage 5).
    3. TEST-07 depends on issues identified in TEST-01 through TEST-06.
* **Critical Path:** TEST-03 (UAT Execution -> Feedback -> Sign-off) is the major gate. TEST-07 (Bug Fixing) cycle time impacts the schedule.
* **Checkpoints:**
  * **Test Plan Review:** Ensure adequate coverage for UAT, performance, security.
  * **UAT Kick-off & Feedback Review Meetings.**
  * **Performance Test Results Review.**
  * **Security Audit Findings Review.**
  * **Bug Triage Meetings:** Prioritize fixes for TEST-07.
  * **Final Test Sign-off Meeting:** Go/No-Go for deployment.
* **Feedback Loops:** UAT provides critical end-user feedback. Performance/Security tests identify crucial fixes. Bug tracking system provides feedback on resolution status.
* **Transition Criteria:** Test coverage goals met. UAT passed and signed off. Critical/High priority bugs fixed and verified. Performance baseline acceptable. Security review completed and critical issues addressed.

**7. Deployment Stage (Orchestration)**

* **Workflow:** Prepare production, automate release, execute launch sequence carefully.
* **Parallelism:** DEPLOY-01 (Prod Env Setup) and DEPLOY-02 (CI/CD Pipeline) can start during the Testing Stage to be ready.
* **Dependencies & Sequencing:**
    1. DEPLOY-01 and DEPLOY-02 should be ready before attempting production deployment.
    2. DEPLOY-03 (Data Migration) plan executed before final cutover if needed.
    3. DEPLOY-04 (Pre-Launch Check) is the final gate before DEPLOY-05.
    4. DEPLOY-05 (Launch) is the live deployment event.
    5. DEPLOY-06 (Monitoring) follows immediately after launch.
* **Critical Path:** DEPLOY-01 -> DEPLOY-02 -> DEPLOY-04 -> DEPLOY-05. Any data migration (DEPLOY-03) is also critical path if required.
* **Checkpoints:**
  * **CI/CD Test Run:** Successful deployment to a staging environment via the pipeline.
  * **Pre-Launch Checklist Review (Go/No-Go):** Final sign-off from stakeholders/team leads.
  * **Post-Launch Smoke Test:** Immediate verification of critical functions in production.
  * **Monitoring Dashboard Review:** Confirm monitoring is active and collecting data.
* **Feedback Loops:** CI/CD pipeline provides feedback on build/test/deploy success. Monitoring provides immediate feedback on production health.
* **Transition Criteria:** Application deployed to production environment, accessible via public URL, CI/CD pipeline operational for production, basic monitoring configured and active. Launch confirmed successful via smoke tests.

**8. Training and Documentation Stage (Orchestration)**

* **Workflow:** Finalize documentation drafted during development. Create training materials. Conduct knowledge transfer.
* **Parallelism:** DOC-01 (Admin), DOC-02 (User), DOC-04 (Code Docs) finalization can run concurrently.
* **Dependencies & Sequencing:**
    1. Documentation (DOC-01, DOC-02, DOC-04) requires the application features/deployment to be finalized (End of Stage 6/7). Should be *drafted* earlier.
    2. DOC-03 (Training Materials) depends on finalized DOC-01/DOC-02.
    3. DOC-05 (Knowledge Transfer) requires completed documentation and deployed system.
* **Critical Path:** Finalizing and publishing user-facing documentation (DOC-01, DOC-02) for support and handover.
* **Checkpoints:**
  * **Documentation Review:** Final review of Admin, User, and Code documentation for clarity, accuracy, and completeness.
  * **Training Material Review.**
  * **Knowledge Transfer Session(s) Completion.**
* **Feedback Loops:** Gather feedback on documentation drafts from team/stakeholders. Refine training based on practice sessions.
* **Maintenance Handover:** Formal process involving review of documentation (DOC-01, DOC-04), system architecture, deployment process (DEPLOY-02), monitoring (DEPLOY-06), and common troubleshooting steps with designated maintainers (if any). Use DOC-05 for this.
* **Transition Criteria:** All documentation finalized, reviewed, and accessible. Training materials created. Knowledge transfer completed. Official project handover (if applicable).
