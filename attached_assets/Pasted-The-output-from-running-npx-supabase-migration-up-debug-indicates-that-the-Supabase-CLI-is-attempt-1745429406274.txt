The output from running npx supabase migration up --debug indicates that the Supabase CLI is attempting to connect to a local PostgreSQL database but is unable to do so. The specific error message suggests that the connection is being refused. Hereâ€™s what this implies from the Supabase side:

    Database Connection Configuration: The Supabase CLI is configured to connect to a PostgreSQL database at 127.0.0.1 on port 54322 using the user postgres and the database postgres. If this configuration is incorrect (e.g., wrong port, wrong user, or wrong database), it will lead to connection issues.

    PostgreSQL Server Status: The refusal to connect typically means that the PostgreSQL server is not running on the specified host and port. This could be due to the server not being started or it being configured to listen on a different port.

    Local Environment Setup: If you are using Supabase locally, ensure that your local PostgreSQL instance is properly set up and running. The Supabase CLI relies on this local instance to apply migrations and perform other database operations.

    Potential Misconfiguration: If you have recently changed any configuration settings (like the port number in the PostgreSQL configuration), ensure that those changes are reflected in your Supabase CLI configuration as well.

    Firewall or Network Issues: If there are any firewall rules or network configurations that prevent access to the specified port, this could also lead to connection refusal.

Next Steps

To resolve the issue, you can take the following actions:

    Start PostgreSQL: Ensure that the PostgreSQL service is running. You can check its status and start it if necessary.

    Check Port Configuration: Verify that PostgreSQL is configured to listen on port 54322. You can check this in the postgresql.conf file.

    Test Connection: Try connecting to the PostgreSQL database using a database client (like psql or a GUI tool) with the same connection details to see if the issue persists outside of the Supabase CLI.

    Review Supabase Configuration: Check if there are any configuration files (like .env or supabase/config.toml) that specify the database connection details and ensure they are correct.

By following these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the connection issue with your local PostgreSQL database when using the Supabase CLI.
