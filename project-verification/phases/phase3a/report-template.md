# Phase 3A Report: Migration & Policy Conflict Resolution

**Date Completed:** [YYYY-MM-DD]

## Area of Focus

Ensuring Supabase migrations are idempotent and free of duplicate policy conflicts.

## Key Questions

### Q3A.1: Migration Errors
- What specific migration conflicts were occurring during `supabase db push`?  

### Q3A.2: Immediate Fixes
- Which remediation path (idempotence guards or history repair) was chosen to unblock migrations?  

### Q3A.3: Structural Improvements
- How should future migration files be structured to prevent duplicate policies?  

### Q3A.4: Remaining Issues
- What loose ends or configuration mismatches remain after remediation?  

## Inventory Findings

[Summarize the conflicts found in `system-issues.md`, including error messages and root causes.]

## Discrepancies Identified

- Duplicate `CREATE POLICY` statements in migration files.
- Lack of `DROP POLICY IF EXISTS` or idempotent guards.

## Remediation Steps

- **Option A (Idempotent Guards):** Describe `DROP POLICY IF EXISTS` insertion details.  
- **Option B (History Repair):** Describe migration squash or migration repair commands.  

## Consistency Verification

- Local migration push logs show no errors.  
- Remote migration push logs show no errors.  

## Test Results

```bash
# Local emulator push
npm run supabase:push:local
# no errors

# Remote project push
npm run supabase:push
# confirm with 'y', no errors
```

## Conclusion

Migration chain is now idempotent; duplicate policy errors resolved.  
Future migrations will follow the updated structural guidelines.

### Next Steps
