# Phase 5: Frontend (Next.js) Implementation Verification

## Objective

Verify the existing Next.js frontend implementation for user management UI and logic. Ensure code and UI consistency, eliminate incompatible implementations and duplication, and confirm correct interaction with the backend API (Phase 4) and adherence to defined standards.

## Key Questions to Answer

- **Q5.1: Pages/Routes:** What specific pages/routes are required for the user management flows?
- **Q5.2: Auth State Management:** How should authentication state (`isLoggedIn`, `user` object, token) be managed client-side?
- **Q5.3: API Interaction:** How should the frontend interact with the backend API?
- **Q5.4: Token Storage:** How should the JWT or session information be stored client-side?
- **Q5.5: Routing & Protection:** How should routing and protected routes be handled?
- **Q5.6: Forms & Validation:** How should user input forms and client-side validation be handled?
- **Q5.7: UI Feedback:** How should loading states and error messages be displayed in the UI?

## Required Deliverables for Mastery

- [ ] Written answers to the 7 "Key Questions" (included in the report)
- [ ] Detailed findings from the Code/UI Inventory (included in the report)
- [ ] Git commits showing the specific fixes, refactoring, and standardization applied
- [ ] Evidence of UI testing via browser:
  - [ ] Screenshots of key pages/forms
  - [ ] Browser console/network tab screenshots showing API calls
  - [ ] (Optional) Screen recordings of critical user flows
- [ ] Completed "Phase 5 Report (Frontend Verification)" documenting your findings and fixes

## Approach

1. First, define your standards by answering the Key Questions
2. Review frontend code and UI related to user management:
   - Pages
   - Components
   - Context providers
   - Hooks
   - API call utilities
3. Manually navigate the existing UI to understand user flows
4. Compare the current implementation to your defined standards
5. Identify inconsistencies, duplications, and non-standard implementations
6. Refactor code to align with your standards:
   - Consolidate auth state management
   - Standardize API calls
   - Implement consistent token storage
   - Apply route protection consistently
   - Standardize UI components and patterns
7. Test all user flows to verify functionality
8. Document findings and fixes in the Phase 5 Report

## Success Criteria

- Frontend UI and code align exactly with the defined standard
- Duplications and inconsistencies documented in the Inventory are verifiably removed/refactored
- UI tests demonstrate correct functionality and user flow
- The Phase 5 Report is detailed and justified, covering findings, fixes, and test outcomes

## Next Steps

After completing Phase 5, proceed to [Phase 6: Email Flow Verification (End-to-End)](../phase6/README.md)
