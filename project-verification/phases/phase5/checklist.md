# Phase 5: Checklist & Step-by-Step Process

## Step 1: Define Standards

Answer these key questions to establish your frontend standards:

- [ ] **Q5.1: Pages/Routes:** Define the required pages/routes
  - [ ] Authentication pages (signup, signin, forgot password, reset password)
  - [ ] Profile pages (view, edit)
  - [ ] Other user management related pages

- [ ] **Q5.2: Auth State Management:** Define the authentication state management approach
  - [ ] State storage method (Context, hooks, state management library)
  - [ ] State initialization process
  - [ ] User information storage
  - [ ] Authentication status tracking

- [ ] **Q5.3: API Interaction:** Define the backend API interaction approach
  - [ ] HTTP client (fetch, axios, etc.)
  - [ ] API service structure
  - [ ] Token attachment method
  - [ ] Error handling

- [ ] **Q5.4: Token Storage:** Define the JWT storage approach
  - [ ] Storage mechanism (localStorage, Cookies, etc.)
  - [ ] Security considerations
  - [ ] Expiration handling

- [ ] **Q5.5: Routing & Protection:** Define the route protection approach
  - [ ] Protection implementation (Next.js Middleware, hooks, components)
  - [ ] Redirection logic
  - [ ] Authentication status checks

- [ ] **Q5.6: Forms & Validation:** Define the form handling approach
  - [ ] Form state management
  - [ ] Validation implementation
  - [ ] Error display
  - [ ] Backend validation error handling

- [ ] **Q5.7: UI Feedback:** Define the UI feedback standards
  - [ ] Loading indicators
  - [ ] Error messages
  - [ ] Success notifications
  - [ ] Disabled state handling

## Step 2: Inventory Frontend Code & UI

- [ ] **Pages:**
  - [ ] Identify all pages related to user management
  - [ ] Check routing structure and naming

- [ ] **Components:**
  - [ ] Identify authentication and profile-related components
  - [ ] Note form handling approaches
  - [ ] Check UI patterns for consistency

- [ ] **State Management:**
  - [ ] Identify how auth state is currently managed
  - [ ] Note initialization patterns
  - [ ] Check persistence approach

- [ ] **API Calls:**
  - [ ] Identify how backend API is called
  - [ ] Note token handling
  - [ ] Check error handling

- [ ] **Route Protection:**
  - [ ] Identify current protection mechanism
  - [ ] Note redirection logic

- [ ] **UI Elements:**
  - [ ] Identify loading indicators
  - [ ] Note error message patterns
  - [ ] Check form validation display

## Step 3: Compare to Standards

- [ ] Check if pages/routes match your standard
- [ ] Check if auth state management matches your standard
- [ ] Check if API interaction matches your standard
- [ ] Check if token storage matches your standard
- [ ] Check if route protection matches your standard
- [ ] Check if form handling/validation matches your standard
- [ ] Check if UI feedback patterns match your standard

## Step 4: Identify Inconsistencies and Duplication

- [ ] Note auth state managed independently across components
- [ ] Note API calls made directly and via a service
- [ ] Note different token storage mechanisms
- [ ] Note inconsistent route protection logic
- [ ] Note varied form implementations
- [ ] Note differing loading/error UI patterns

## Step 5: Implement Fixes

- [ ] **Refactor State Management:**
  - [ ] Consolidate auth state logic (e.g., AuthContext)
  - [ ] Ensure correct initialization and token persistence

- [ ] **Standardize API Calls:**
  - [ ] Create/refactor API client service
  - [ ] Ensure consistent token attachment
  - [ ] Implement standard error handling

- [ ] **Implement Token Storage:**
  - [ ] Standardize JWT storage method
  - [ ] Ensure secure handling

- [ ] **Standardize Route Protection:**
  - [ ] Implement consistent protection mechanism
  - [ ] Apply to all relevant pages

- [ ] **Standardize UI Components:**
  - [ ] Refactor forms for consistency
  - [ ] Implement standard validation display
  - [ ] Create consistent loading indicators
  - [ ] Standardize error messages

- [ ] **Eliminate Duplication:**
  - [ ] Remove redundant components
  - [ ] Consolidate repeated logic

## Step 6: Test User Flows

- [ ] **Signup Flow:**
  - [ ] Navigate to signup page
  - [ ] Test validation
  - [ ] Submit valid data
  - [ ] Verify API call
  - [ ] Check for appropriate feedback

- [ ] **Login Flow:**
  - [ ] Navigate to login page
  - [ ] Test validation
  - [ ] Submit valid credentials
  - [ ] Verify API call and token storage
  - [ ] Check redirection

- [ ] **Profile View/Edit:**
  - [ ] Navigate to profile page
  - [ ] Verify data display
  - [ ] Test edit functionality
  - [ ] Check validation
  - [ ] Submit changes
  - [ ] Verify API call
  - [ ] Check for appropriate feedback

- [ ] **Logout:**
  - [ ] Test logout action
  - [ ] Verify token removal
  - [ ] Check redirection

- [ ] **Password Reset:**
  - [ ] Navigate to forgot password page
  - [ ] Submit email
  - [ ] Check feedback
  - [ ] Test reset page with token (will be tested more in Phase 6)

- [ ] **Route Protection:**
  - [ ] Attempt to access protected pages when logged out
  - [ ] Verify redirection
  - [ ] Attempt to access login/signup when logged in
  - [ ] Verify redirection

- [ ] **Browser Console:**
  - [ ] Check for JavaScript errors during flows
  - [ ] Verify network calls to correct endpoints
  - [ ] Confirm auth headers are present on protected calls

## Step 7: Document and Verify

- [ ] Document all findings in the Phase 5 Report
- [ ] Include UI/UX test evidence (screenshots, console logs)
- [ ] Verify code searches confirm duplication elimination
- [ ] Confirm all standards are now consistently applied

## Tests for this Phase

- [ ] All user flows (signup, login, profile CRUD, logout) function correctly
- [ ] Browser Network tab confirms correct API calls are made with valid auth headers
- [ ] Browser Console shows no JavaScript errors during core flows
- [ ] Route protection redirects work as expected
- [ ] Form validation and error messages display correctly
- [ ] UI feedback (loading, success, error states) works consistently

## Inspection Pass-Gate

To pass this phase, you must have:

1. Clearly defined standards for all aspects of frontend implementation
2. Documented all inconsistencies and duplications found during inventory
3. Refactored code to use consistent patterns and approaches
4. Removed duplicate functionality and consolidated code
5. Successfully tested all user flows with evidence
6. Verified that code and UI now align with defined standards
7. Completed the Phase 5 Report with accurate information

Once all checklist items are complete and all tests pass, you can proceed to Phase 6.
