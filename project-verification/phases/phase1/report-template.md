## Final Verification

### Complete Build Sequence

```
# Command output from final verification
[package_manager] install
cd backend && [package_manager] run build
cd frontend && [package_manager] run build
```

### Server Startup

```
# Backend server startup output
cd backend && [package_manager] run start:dev
```

```
# Frontend server startup output
cd frontend && [package_manager] run dev
```

[Include screenshot of browser showing application loading]
[Include screenshot of browser console showing no build errors]

## Conclusion

The project build is now stable, and development servers can be started cleanly. All existing build errors identified in Phase 0 have been resolved, providing a runnable base for detailed verification in subsequent phases.

### Next Steps

Proceed to Phase 2 to standardize configuration and environment variable handling across the project.
