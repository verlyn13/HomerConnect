# Phase 1: Checklist & Step-by-Step Process

## Step-by-Step Debugging & Resolution

### Error Resolution Workflow

For each error identified in Phase 0:

1. [ ] Analyze the error message in detail
2. [ ] Research potential causes (documentation, forums, etc.)
3. [ ] Identify the root cause through debugging
4. [ ] Apply a specific fix
5. [ ] Re-run the command to verify the fix
6. [ ] Document the fix, cause, and resolution in your report
7. [ ] Commit your changes with a descriptive message

### Priority Order

1. [ ] Package Installation Errors
   - [ ] Fix package version conflicts
   - [ ] Resolve missing dependencies
   - [ ] Address node version compatibility issues

2. [ ] Build Errors
   - [ ] Fix TypeScript/JavaScript syntax issues
   - [ ] Resolve type errors
   - [ ] Address missing files or imports
   - [ ] Fix configuration errors

3. [ ] Development Server Startup Errors
   - [ ] Fix runtime errors preventing server start
   - [ ] Address missing environment variables needed for startup
   - [ ] Resolve port conflicts or access issues

### Final Verification Sequence

- [ ] Clean node_modules: `rm -rf node_modules` (or equivalent)
- [ ] Clean install: `[package_manager] install`
- [ ] Backend build: `cd backend && [package_manager] run build`
- [ ] Frontend build: `cd frontend && [package_manager] run build`
- [ ] Backend dev server: `cd backend && [package_manager] run start:dev`
- [ ] Frontend dev server: `cd frontend && [package_manager] run dev`
- [ ] Browser console check for errors

## Tests for this Phase

- [ ] `[package_manager] install` completes without critical errors
- [ ] `[package_manager] run build` in both backend and frontend directories completes successfully (exit code 0)
- [ ] `[package_manager] run start:dev` in the backend directory starts successfully and listens on its configured port
- [ ] `[package_manager] run dev` in the frontend directory starts successfully and is accessible in the browser
- [ ] Browser console does not show *build-related* errors (runtime errors related to functionality are acceptable at this stage)

## Debugging Techniques

- Error message analysis
- Documentation search
- Print debugging (`console.log`)
- Code inspection
- Online research for similar issues
- Version compatibility checks
- Dependency tree examination (`npm ls` or equivalent)

## Inspection Pass-Gate

To pass this phase, you must have:

1. Resolved all build and startup errors identified in Phase 0
2. Documented each error, its cause, and the implemented fix
3. Provided commit references for each fix
4. Successfully verified the full build and startup sequence works cleanly
5. Completed the Phase 1 Report with accurate information

Once all checklist items are complete and all tests pass, you can proceed to Phase 2.
