# Phase 1: Stabilize the Build Environment

## Objective

Resolve all build and immediate startup errors identified in Phase 0 to achieve a clean build and functional development servers for both backend and frontend.

## Key Questions to Answer

- What is causing each build error identified in Phase 0?
- What changes are needed to fix these errors?
- Can we achieve a clean build for both backend and frontend?
- Can we successfully start the development servers?

## Required Deliverables for Mastery

- [ ] Clean command output from `[package_manager] install` (at root) showing no critical errors
- [ ] Successful command output from backend `[package_manager] run build`
- [ ] Successful command output from backend `[package_manager] run start:dev` (showing it's listening)
- [ ] Successful command output from frontend `[package_manager] run build`
- [ ] Successful command output from frontend `[package_manager] run dev` (showing it's accessible)
- [ ] Screenshot of browser console confirming no build-related errors
- [ ] Git commits showing the exact changes made to fix *each* error (reference commit hashes in the report)
- [ ] Completed "Phase 1 Report (Build Stabilization)" documenting your findings and fixes

## Approach

1. First, address errors from `[package_manager] install` and `[package_manager] run build`
2. Then tackle errors that occur when running the dev servers
3. For each error:
   - Analyze the error message
   - Investigate the cause
   - Apply a specific fix
   - Re-run the command to verify the fix
   - Document the fix in the Phase 1 Report
4. Perform a final check with a full install, build, and dev server sequence

## Success Criteria

- The project builds and development servers run cleanly without startup errors
- The Phase 1 Report accurately logs *each* error from Phase 0, its identified cause, implemented fix (with commit references), and verifiable confirmation it was resolved

## Next Steps

After completing Phase 1, proceed to [Phase 2: Configuration & Environment Variable Consistency](../phase2/README.md)
