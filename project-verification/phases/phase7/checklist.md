# Phase 7: Checklist & Step-by-Step Process

## Step 1: Audit Documentation

- [ ] **Review All Phase Reports:**
  - [ ] Verify Phase 0 Report is complete
  - [ ] Verify Phase 1 Report is complete
  - [ ] Verify Phase 2 Report is complete
  - [ ] Verify Phase 3 Report is complete
  - [ ] Verify Phase 4 Report is complete
  - [ ] Verify Phase 5 Report is complete
  - [ ] Verify Phase 6 Report is complete

- [ ] **Check Documentation Quality:**
  - [ ] Check for clarity and readability
  - [ ] Verify grammar and spelling
  - [ ] Ensure proper formatting
  - [ ] Confirm evidence is included (screenshots, logs, etc.)

- [ ] **Verify Documentation Consistency:**
  - [ ] Ensure standards defined in earlier phases are consistent with later phases
  - [ ] Check that descriptions of components/features are consistent throughout
  - [ ] Verify no contradictory information exists between sections
  - [ ] Confirm that documented fixes align with the current codebase

## Step 2: Audit Final Documentation

- [ ] **Verify Environment Variables Documentation:**
  - [ ] Check that all required variables are listed
  - [ ] Verify descriptions are accurate
  - [ ] Confirm variable naming follows the standard
  - [ ] Ensure no secrets are included

- [ ] **Verify Supabase Configuration Documentation:**
  - [ ] Check auth settings are accurately documented
  - [ ] Verify database schema is correctly described
  - [ ] Confirm RLS policies are properly documented
  - [ ] Ensure triggers/functions are accurately described
  - [ ] Verify SMTP settings are correctly documented (minus secrets)

- [ ] **Verify Backend Structure Documentation:**
  - [ ] Check that key code examples are included
  - [ ] Verify examples are current and accurate
  - [ ] Confirm all standard patterns are shown
  - [ ] Ensure no outdated code is included

- [ ] **Verify Frontend Structure Documentation:**
  - [ ] Check that key code examples are included
  - [ ] Verify examples are current and accurate
  - [ ] Confirm all standard patterns are shown
  - [ ] Ensure no outdated code is included

## Step 3: Audit Codebase (Final Pass)

- [ ] **Check for Environment Variable Consistency:**
  - [ ] Search for direct `process.env` usage:

    ```
    grep -R "process.env" backend/src
    grep -R "process.env" frontend/src
    ```

  - [ ] Verify all access follows the standard from Phase 2

- [ ] **Check for Hardcoded Values:**
  - [ ] Search for potential hardcoded configuration:

    ```
    grep -R "supabase" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" .
    grep -R "http://" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" .
    grep -R "https://" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" .
    ```

  - [ ] Verify no secrets or configuration values are hardcoded

- [ ] **Check for Duplicated Logic:**
  - [ ] Review auth-related code for duplication
  - [ ] Check profile-related code for duplication
  - [ ] Verify API call patterns are consistent
  - [ ] Ensure error handling is standardized

- [ ] **Verify Consistent Patterns:**
  - [ ] Check backend controller patterns
  - [ ] Verify service method patterns
  - [ ] Check frontend component patterns
  - [ ] Verify hook usage patterns

## Step 4: Audit Configuration Files

- [ ] **Verify `.env.example`:**
  - [ ] Compare against all code that uses environment variables
  - [ ] Ensure all required variables are listed
  - [ ] Check that descriptions/comments are helpful
  - [ ] Verify no actual secrets are included

- [ ] **Verify `.gitignore`:**
  - [ ] Check that all `.env` files are listed
  - [ ] Verify any other files with secrets are excluded
  - [ ] Run `git status` to confirm no secret files are tracked
  - [ ] Check for any sensitive files in git history

## Step 5: Identify and Fix Remaining Issues

- [ ] **Document Any Documentation Issues:**
  - [ ] Note missing or unclear sections
  - [ ] Identify inconsistencies between phases
  - [ ] List any outdated information

- [ ] **Document Any Code Issues:**
  - [ ] Note any remaining direct `process.env` usage
  - [ ] List any hardcoded values
  - [ ] Identify any duplicated logic
  - [ ] Note any inconsistent patterns

- [ ] **Document Any Configuration Issues:**
  - [ ] List any missing variables in `.env.example`
  - [ ] Note any issues with `.gitignore`

- [ ] **Implement Fixes:**
  - [ ] Update documentation for clarity and consistency
  - [ ] Fix any remaining code issues
  - [ ] Update configuration files as needed

## Step 6: Final Update to Documentation

- [ ] Update the Phase 7 Report with all findings and fixes
- [ ] Make any final updates to previous phase reports if needed
- [ ] Ensure the final documentation in `/final-documentation` is complete and accurate

## Tests for this Phase

- [ ] The documentation has been reviewed and is complete, clear, and consistent
- [ ] Code searches confirm no remaining issues with the patterns established in earlier phases
- [ ] `.env.example` is confirmed to be complete and accurate
- [ ] `.gitignore` is confirmed to correctly exclude secret files

## Inspection Pass-Gate

To pass this phase, you must have:

1. Completed a thorough review of all documentation
2. Performed a final audit of the codebase for any remaining issues
3. Verified configuration files are accurate and complete
4. Fixed any minor issues found during the final audit
5. Updated the documentation to reflect the final state
6. Completed the Phase 7 Report with accurate information

Once all checklist items are complete and all tests pass, the project verification workflow is complete!
