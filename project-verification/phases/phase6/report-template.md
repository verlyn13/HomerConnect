# Phase 6 Report: Email Flow Verification (End-to-End)

**Date Completed:** [YYYY-MM-DD]

## Area of Focus

Email Authentication and Password Reset Flows

## "Needs to Be" (Defined Standard)

### Q6.1: Signup Flow

[Your defined standard step-by-step flow for signup with email confirmation]

### Q6.2: Password Reset Flow

[Your defined standard step-by-step flow for password reset]

### Q6.3: Mailtrap Verification

[Your defined process for verifying emails with Mailtrap]

## "Inventory" Findings (Initial State across layers)

### Signup Confirmation Flow

[Describe findings, e.g., "Signup triggers email, but Supabase Auth redirect URL setting is incorrect, causing the confirmation link to go to the wrong frontend page."]

### Password Reset Trigger

[Describe findings, e.g., "`/forgot-password` form exists in frontend and calls a backend endpoint, but the backend endpoint calls a deprecated Supabase method or uses incorrect parameters."]

### Reset Page/Token Handling

[Describe findings, e.g., "`/reset-password` page exists in frontend, but doesn't correctly extract the token from the URL or use it when calling Supabase's update method."]

### Cross-layer Inconsistencies/Duplication

[e.g., "Supabase SMTP verified in Phase 3 is correct, but backend code also tries to send a manual email via another library for password reset, leading to duplicate/conflicting emails."]

## Discrepancies Found

### Inventory vs. Needs-to-Be

[Explicitly list all differences between your standard flows and what was found]

### Internal Inconsistencies/Duplication

[Explicitly list any internal inconsistencies or duplications found across code/config related to these flows]

- [e.g., "Supabase redirect URL mismatch."]
- [e.g., "Incorrect Supabase method used in backend for password reset."]
- [e.g., "Frontend not reading token correctly from reset link."]
- [e.g., "Redundant manual email sending logic in backend."]

## Debugging & Fixes Implemented

[Detailed steps taken to resolve each discrepancy and align with the standard flow. Reference commit hashes and mention changes made in Supabase dashboard settings if applicable.]

### Supabase Settings Corrections

- [e.g., "Corrected Supabase Auth redirect URL for confirmation email in Supabase settings."]

### Backend Email Flow Fixes

- [e.g., "Updated backend endpoint to use `supabase.auth.resetPasswordForEmail` method with correct parameters. Commit: `abcdef1`"]

```typescript
// Example of corrected password reset endpoint
@Post('forgot-password')
async forgotPassword(@Body() dto: ForgotPasswordDto) {
  const { error } = await this.supabaseService.getClient().auth.resetPasswordForEmail(
    dto.email,
    { redirectTo: this.configService.get('PASSWORD_RESET_URL') }
  );

  if (error) {
    throw new BadRequestException(error.message);
  }

  return { message: 'Password reset email sent' };
}
```

### Frontend Token Handling Improvements

- [e.g., "Implemented URL token extraction on `/reset-password` page using Next.js router and passed to Supabase `verifyOtp` call. Commit: `abcdef2`"]

```tsx
// Example of token extraction and handling on reset page
const ResetPassword = () => {
  const router = useRouter();
  const { token } = router.query;

  const handleSubmit = async (data) => {
    try {
      const { error } = await supabase.auth.verifyOtp({
        token_hash: token as string,
        type: 'recovery',
        new_password: data.password,
      });

      if (error) throw error;
      // Handle success...
    } catch (error) {
      // Handle error...
    }
  };

  // Reset form implementation...
};
```

### Duplication Elimination

- [e.g., "Removed redundant manual email sending code in backend. Commit: `abcdef3`"]

## Consistency Verification

[Summary confirming that email authentication and password reset flows now function end-to-end consistently across frontend, backend, and Supabase using Mailtrap for testing, according to the defined standard. Inconsistencies eliminated.]

## Test Results

### Signup Confirmation Flow Testing

**Steps Performed:**

1. Created new user through signup form
2. Checked Mailtrap for confirmation email
3. Clicked confirmation link
4. Verified user status

**Evidence:**

- [Screenshot of Mailtrap showing confirmation email]
- [Screenshot of email content]
- [Screenshot of confirmation success page]
- [Evidence of user status change (e.g., Supabase dashboard or login success)]

**Result:** [Success/Failure with details]

### Password Reset Flow Testing

**Steps Performed:**

1. Requested password reset for existing user
2. Checked Mailtrap for reset email
3. Clicked reset link
4. Verified token in URL and reset page loading
5. Entered and submitted new password
6. Tested login with new password
7. Tested login with old password (should fail)

**Evidence:**

- [Screenshot of Mailtrap showing reset email]
- [Screenshot of email content]
- [Screenshot of reset page with token in URL]
- [Screenshot of password update success]
- [Evidence of successful login with new password]
- [Evidence of failed login with old password]

**Result:** [Success/Failure with details]

### Unexpected Email Check

**Finding:** [e.g., "No unexpected emails were sent to Mailtrap during other operations."]

## Conclusion

The email authentication and password reset flows have been verified, debugged, and corrected. They function consistently and correctly across all layers using Mailtrap for testing.

### Next Steps

Proceed to Phase 7 for the final documentation and project consistency audit.
