# Phase 6: Email Flow Verification (End-to-End)

## Objective

Verify the complete end-to-end implementation of the email authentication (signup confirmation) and password reset flows, confirming correct interaction between frontend, backend, Supabase, and Mailtrap, and ensuring consistency of the overall flow.

## Key Questions to Answer

- **Q6.1: Signup Flow:** What is the required step-by-step flow for signup with email confirmation?
- **Q6.2: Password Reset Flow:** What is the required step-by-step flow for password reset?
- **Q6.3: Mailtrap Verification:** How are Mailtrap emails verified during testing?

## Required Deliverables for Mastery

- [ ] Written answers to the 3 "Key Questions" (included in the report)
- [ ] Detailed findings from the cross-layer Inventory (included in the report)
- [ ] Git commits showing code/config changes implemented to fix the email flows
- [ ] Evidence of end-to-end testing using Mailtrap:
  - [ ] Screenshot of the signup confirmation email
  - [ ] Proof the confirmation link works
  - [ ] Screenshot of the password reset email
  - [ ] Proof the reset link contains the correct token/params
  - [ ] Proof that entering a new password successfully updates the password
- [ ] Completed "Phase 6 Report (Email Flow Verification)" documenting your findings and fixes

## Approach

1. First, define your standards by answering the Key Questions
2. Review the relevant code and configuration across all layers:
   - Supabase Auth settings (from Phase 3)
   - Backend code for email-related endpoints
   - Frontend code for handling email confirmation and password reset
3. Mentally trace the defined flows through the codebase
4. Identify broken steps, inconsistencies, or duplications
5. Implement fixes to align with your standards:
   - Correct Supabase settings if needed
   - Align frontend/backend logic for email flows
   - Fix token handling
   - Eliminate duplicated logic
6. Test the complete flows end-to-end using Mailtrap
7. Document findings and fixes in the Phase 6 Report

## Success Criteria

- Both the signup confirmation and password reset email flows function correctly end-to-end
- The Phase 6 Report accurately documents the flows, discrepancies found, fixes applied, and evidence of successful testing
- No significant inconsistencies or duplications remain in how these flows are handled across layers

## Next Steps

After completing Phase 6, proceed to [Phase 7: Documentation & Project Consistency Audit](../phase7/README.md)
