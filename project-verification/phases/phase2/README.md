# Phase 2: Configuration & Environment Variable Consistency

## Objective

Define a consistent standard for handling environment variables and configuration across the project. Inventory the current state, identify and eliminate all inconsistencies, duplication, and hardcoded values in how configuration is defined and accessed.

## Key Questions to Answer

- **Q2.1: Env File Location:** Where should environment variables be defined for development?
- **Q2.2: Naming Convention:** What naming convention should be used for environment variables?
- **Q2.3: Backend Access:** How should environment variables be accessed in the NestJS backend?
- **Q2.4: Frontend Access:** How should environment variables be accessed in the Next.js frontend?
- **Q2.5: Secrets Identification:** Which environment variables are secrets and must NEVER be committed to Git?
- **Q2.6: `.env.example` Structure:** How will `.env.example` be structured?

## Required Deliverables for Mastery

- [ ] Written answers to the 6 "Key Questions" (included in the report)
- [ ] Detailed findings from the Configuration Inventory (included in the report)
- [ ] Git commits showing all changes made to configuration files, `.gitignore`, and code accessing env vars
- [ ] The finalized `.env.example` file content
- [ ] Confirmation that actual `.env` files containing secrets are correctly ignored by Git
- [ ] Completed "Phase 2 Report (Config Consistency)" documenting your findings and fixes

## Approach

1. First, define your standards by answering the Key Questions
2. Inventory all configuration files and usage patterns across the project
3. Compare the current state to your defined standards
4. Identify inconsistencies, duplications, and hardcoded values
5. Implement fixes to align with your standards:
   - Refactor code to use standard access methods
   - Consolidate configuration definitions
   - Eliminate redundant variables and hardcoded values
   - Fix naming conventions
   - Update `.gitignore`
   - Create/update `.env.example`
6. Test that the application still works with the consolidated configuration
7. Document findings and fixes in the Phase 2 Report

## Success Criteria

- The defined standard is clear and documented
- The Phase 2 Report accurately identifies inconsistencies and duplications found *before* fixing
- The code reflects the standard and removes duplication
- Secrets are not in Git
- The report confirms consistency and successful tests *after* fixing

## Next Steps

After completing Phase 2, proceed to [Phase 3: Supabase Configuration Verification](../phase3/README.md)
