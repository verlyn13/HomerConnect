# Phase 2 Report: Configuration & Environment Variable Consistency

**Date Completed:** [YYYY-MM-DD]

## Area of Focus

Configuration and Environment Variable Handling

## "Needs to Be" (Defined Standard)

### Q2.1: Env File Location

[Your defined standard for where environment variables should be defined]

### Q2.2: Naming Convention

[Your defined standard for environment variable naming]

### Q2.3: Backend Access

[Your defined standard for accessing environment variables in the backend]

### Q2.4: Frontend Access

[Your defined standard for accessing environment variables in the frontend]

### Q2.5: Secrets Identification

[List of variables identified as secrets that must never be committed to Git]

### Q2.6: `.env.example` Structure

[Your defined standard for how `.env.example` should be structured]

## "Inventory" Findings (Initial State)

### Files Found

[List all .env and config files found in the codebase]

### Variable Usage Patterns

[Describe how variables were found to be used, e.g., "Mix of direct process.env and @nestjs/config in backend", "Some hardcoded URLs in frontend components"]

### Secrets Handling Status

[e.g., ".env files present, but not listed in .gitignore", "Some secrets hardcoded"]

## Discrepancies Found

### Inventory vs. Needs-to-Be

[Explicitly list all differences between your standard and what was found in the Inventory]

### Internal Inconsistencies/Duplication

[Explicitly list all internal inconsistencies or duplications found]

- [e.g., "Backend not consistently using @nestjs/config."]
- [e.g., "Frontend directly accessing process.env without NEXT_PUBLIC_ checks."]
- [e.g., "SUPABASE_URL defined in both root/.env and backend/.env."]
- [e.g., "Mailtrap password found hardcoded in backend file X."]
- [e.g., "Inconsistent naming convention for some variables."]

## Debugging & Fixes Implemented

[Detailed steps taken to resolve each discrepancy and implement the standard. Reference commit hashes.]

### Configuration Access Standardization

- [e.g., "Installed `@nestjs/config` and refactored backend services to use `ConfigService`. Commit: `abcdef1`"]

### Hardcoded Values Elimination

- [e.g., "Replaced hardcoded URLs in frontend component Y with `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_API_URL`. Commit: `abcdef2`"]

### Environment Files Consolidation

- [e.g., "Consolidated `.env` files according to standard, removed duplicates. Commit: `abcdef3`"]

### Git Security Improvements

- [e.g., "Added secret files to `.gitignore`. Commit: `abcdef4`"]

### Documentation Updates

- [e.g., "Created/Updated `.env.example` at root. Commit: `abcdef5`"]

## Consistency Verification

[Summary confirming that environment variables are now defined and accessed according to the defined standard across the project]

## Final `.env.example` Content

```dotenv
# Example .env file (secrets redacted)
# This is the final consolidated .env.example file

# General
NODE_ENV=development

# Supabase
SUPABASE_URL="https://your-project.supabase.co"
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="your-anon-key"
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="your-service-role-key"

# [Continue with all other variables]
```

## Test Results

[Summarize outcomes of tests, including `git status` verification and code search results]

- [e.g., "Application starts successfully using refactored config loading."]
- [e.g., "`git status` confirms `.env.local` and backend `.env` are ignored."]
- [e.g., "`grep -R "process.env" backend/src` shows no direct usage except in entry file initialization logic."]

## Conclusion

Environment variable and configuration handling has been verified, standardized, and corrected. A consistent, secure foundation is established for subsequent phases.

### Next Steps

Proceed to Phase 3 to verify and standardize the Supabase configuration.
