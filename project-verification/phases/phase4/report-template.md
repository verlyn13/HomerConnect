# Phase 4 Report: Backend (NestJS) Implementation Verification

**Date Completed:** [YYYY-MM-DD]

## Area of Focus

NestJS Backend Implementation for User Management

## "Needs to Be" (Defined Standard)

### Q4.1: Supabase Client Usage

[Your defined standard for Supabase client initialization and usage]

### Q4.2: API Endpoints

[Your defined standard for API endpoints, including routes, methods, request/response formats, and status codes]

### Q4.3: Input Validation

[Your defined standard for input validation]

### Q4.4: Auth & Authz

[Your defined standard for authentication and authorization]

### Q4.5: Error Handling

[Your defined standard for error handling and reporting]

### Q4.6: Logging

[Your defined standard for logging]

## "Inventory" Findings (Initial State)

### Supabase Client Usage

[Describe findings, e.g., "Client initialized in multiple services, both Anon and Service Role keys used without clear justification."]

### API Endpoints

[List found endpoints and methods, e.g., "Found `/auth/register` and `/auth/signup` endpoints with similar logic. `/profile` endpoint exists but uses GET method incorrectly for updates."]

### Validation

[Describe findings, e.g., "Validation applied inconsistently, some DTOs missing validators, some checks done manually in controllers."]

### Auth/Authz

[Describe findings, e.g., "Authentication checks are mixed - some in Guards, some manually in controllers. RLS is enabled but not fully relied upon in all relevant service methods."]

### Error Handling

[Describe findings, e.g., "Mix of uncaught errors, generic 500s, and inconsistent custom exceptions. Error response format varies."]

### Logging

[Describe findings, e.g., "Mostly `console.log` statements, no structured logging library."]

## Discrepancies Found

### Inventory vs. Needs-to-Be

[Explicitly list all differences between your standard and what was found]

### Internal Inconsistencies/Duplication

[Explicitly list all internal inconsistencies or duplications found in the code]

- [e.g., "Supabase client initialization is duplicated."]
- [e.g., "Redundant `/auth/register` endpoint."]
- [e.g., "Input validation is missing on PATCH /profile."]
- [e.g., "Authentication logic is duplicated in AuthGuard and UserController."]
- [e.g., "Errors from Supabase are not consistently mapped to `HttpException`."]

## Debugging & Fixes Implemented

[Detailed steps taken to resolve each discrepancy and implement the standard. Reference commit hashes.]

### Supabase Client Standardization

- [e.g., "Consolidated Supabase client initialization into a single `SupabaseService`. Commit: `abcdef1`"]

```typescript
// Example of refactored SupabaseService
@Injectable()
export class SupabaseService {
  private client: SupabaseClient;

  constructor(private configService: ConfigService) {
    this.client = createClient(
      this.configService.get<string>('SUPABASE_URL'),
      this.configService.get<string>('SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY')
    );
  }

  getClient(): SupabaseClient {
    return this.client;
  }
}
```

### API Endpoint Normalization

- [e.g., "Removed duplicate `/auth/register` endpoint, standardized on `POST /auth/signup`. Commit: `abcdef2`"]
- [e.g., "Refactored profile endpoints to follow RESTful patterns. Commit: `abcdef3`"]

### Validation Implementation

- [e.g., "Implemented validation pipe and DTO for `PATCH /profile` request body. Commit: `abcdef4`"]

```typescript
// Example of added validation
export class UpdateProfileDto {
  @IsOptional()
  @IsString()
  username?: string;

  @IsOptional()
  @IsUrl()
  avatar_url?: string;
}
```

### Auth/Authz Standardization

- [e.g., "Refactored all authentication checks into the `AuthGuard` and applied `@UseGuards(AuthGuard)` to protected routes. Removed manual checks from controllers. Commit: `abcdef5`"]

### Error Handling Improvement

- [e.g., "Implemented error interception or mapping logic to catch Supabase errors and return appropriate NestJS `HttpException`. Ensured consistent error response format. Commit: `abcdef6`"]

### Logging Setup

- [e.g., "Integrated Winston logger and replaced all `console.log` statements in user management code. Commit: `abcdef7`"]

## Consistency Verification

[Summary confirming that backend code for user management now aligns with the defined standards. Code searches confirming inconsistencies and duplications have been removed/refactored.]

## API Endpoint Test Results

### Authentication Endpoints

#### POST /auth/signup

**Request:**

```json
{
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "password": "securePassword123"  # pragma: allowlist secret
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "message": "User created successfully. Check your email for confirmation link."
}
```

**Status:** 201 Created

**Screenshot:** [Include screenshot of Postman/Insomnia/curl request and response]

#### POST /auth/signin

**Request:**

```json
{
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "password": "securePassword123"  # pragma: allowlist secret
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
  "user": {
    "id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
    "email": "test@example.com"
  }
}
```

**Status:** 200 OK

**Screenshot:** [Include screenshot]

[Continue with all endpoint tests, including validation error cases and authentication failures]

### Validation Testing

[Example of validation error test case and response]

### Authentication Testing

## Conclusion

The NestJS backend implementation has been verified, debugged, and corrected to provide a consistent, correct, and secure API for user management, adhering to defined standards and eliminating duplication.

### Next Steps

Proceed to Phase 5 to verify the frontend (Next.js) implementation.
