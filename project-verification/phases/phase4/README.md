# Phase 4: Backend (NestJS) Implementation Verification

## Objective

Verify the existing NestJS backend implementation for user management API endpoints. Ensure code consistency, eliminate incompatible implementations and duplication, and confirm correct interaction with Supabase and adherence to the defined configuration standards (Phase 2 & 3).

## Key Questions to Answer

- **Q4.1: Supabase Client Usage:** How should the Supabase client be initialized and used in NestJS?
- **Q4.2: API Endpoints:** What specific API endpoints are required for user management?
- **Q4.3: Input Validation:** How should input validation be handled for incoming API requests?
- **Q4.4: Auth & Authz:** How should authentication and authorization be handled in the backend?
- **Q4.5: Error Handling:** How should errors from Supabase or backend logic be handled and reported via the API?
- **Q4.6: Logging:** How should backend logs be implemented for user management operations?

## Required Deliverables for Mastery

- [ ] Written answers to the 6 "Key Questions" (included in the report)
- [ ] Detailed findings from the Code Inventory (included in the report), listing inconsistencies/duplications
- [ ] Git commits showing the specific fixes, refactoring, and standardization applied
- [ ] Evidence of API endpoint testing:
  - [ ] Saved requests/collections (export or screenshots)
  - [ ] Output logs or screenshots showing request/response details
- [ ] Completed "Phase 4 Report (Backend Verification)" documenting your findings and fixes

## Approach

1. First, define your standards by answering the Key Questions
2. Review all backend code related to user management:
   - Controllers
   - Services
   - Modules
   - Guards
   - Interceptors
   - Config files
3. Compare the current implementation to your defined standards
4. Identify inconsistencies, duplications, and non-standard implementations
5. Refactor code to align with your standards:
   - Standardize Supabase client usage
   - Normalize API endpoints and formats
   - Implement consistent validation
   - Apply authentication and authorization patterns
   - Standardize error handling
   - Implement proper logging
6. Test all API endpoints to verify functionality
7. Document findings and fixes in the Phase 4 Report

## Success Criteria

- Backend code aligns exactly with the defined standard and API spec
- Duplications and inconsistencies documented in the Inventory are verifiably removed/refactored
- API tests pass for happy paths, authentication, authorization, and validation error scenarios
- The Phase 4 Report is detailed and justified, covering findings, fixes, and test outcomes

## Next Steps

After completing Phase 4, proceed to [Phase 5: Frontend (Next.js) Implementation Verification](../phase5/README.md)
