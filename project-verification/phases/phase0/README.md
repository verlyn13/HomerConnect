# Phase 0: Initial Assessment & Build Error Identification

## Objective

Get a preliminary overview of the project structure, identify the tools currently in use for user management, and capture initial build errors.

## Key Questions to Answer

- What is the current project structure?
- What libraries/tools are being used for authentication and user management?
- What build errors are present in the current codebase?
- Can the development servers start successfully?

## Required Deliverables for Mastery

- [ ] Confirmation (`git status` output or screenshot) that the codebase was committed before starting Phase 0
- [ ] *Exact* command output from `[package_manager] install` (at root)
- [ ] *Exact* command output from backend `[package_manager] run build`
- [ ] *Exact* command output from frontend `[package_manager] run build`
- [ ] *Exact* command output from backend `[package_manager] run start:dev` attempt
- [ ] *Exact* command output and browser console output (screenshot) from frontend `[package_manager] run dev` attempt
- [ ] Completed "Phase 0 Report" documenting your findings

## Approach

1. First, scan the codebase to understand its structure
2. Identify the key libraries and tools being used
3. Attempt to build and run the application
4. Document all errors encountered
5. Complete the Phase 0 Report with your findings

## Success Criteria

The Phase 0 Report accurately lists *every* captured error encountered during the initial attempts and notes initial project observations.

## Next Steps

After completing Phase 0, proceed to [Phase 1: Stabilize the Build Environment](../phase1/README.md)
