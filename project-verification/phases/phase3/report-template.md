# Phase 3 Report: Supabase Configuration Verification

**Date Completed:** [YYYY-MM-DD]

## Area of Focus

Supabase Configuration for User Management

## "Needs to Be" (Defined Standard)

### Q3.1: Auth Settings

[Your defined standard for Supabase Authentication settings]

### Q3.2: Database Schema

[Your defined standard for database schema]

### Q3.3: Row Level Security (RLS)

[Your defined standard for RLS policies]

### Q3.4: Triggers/Functions

[Your defined standard for triggers/functions]

### Q3.5: SMTP Configuration

[Your defined standard for SMTP settings]

## "Inventory" Findings (Initial State)

### Auth Settings

[Describe initial state, include screenshots]

### Database Schema

[Describe initial schema (e.g., profiles table), include SQL output or screenshots. Note missing columns/constraints.]

### RLS

[Describe initial RLS status (enabled/disabled) and policies, include SQL output or screenshots. Note missing policies or incorrect conditions.]

### Triggers

[Describe initial trigger status (present/missing, enabled/disabled), include SQL output or screenshots.]

### SMTP

[Describe initial SMTP settings status, include screenshot.]

## Discrepancies Found

### Inventory vs. Needs-to-Be

[Explicitly list all differences between your standard and what was found in the Inventory]

### Internal Inconsistencies

[Explicitly list any internal inconsistencies found within the Supabase config (e.g., conflicting policies, redundant tables)]

- [e.g., "Auth setting Email Confirmation was OFF."]
- [e.g., "`profiles` table missing `avatar_url` column."]
- [e.g., "RLS UPDATE policy missing on `profiles` table."]
- [e.g., "User creation trigger was disabled."]
- [e.g., "SMTP settings were empty."]

## Debugging & Fixes Implemented

[Detailed steps taken to resolve each discrepancy in Supabase (UI clicks or SQL statements)]

### Auth Settings Updates

- [e.g., "Enabled Email Confirmation in Supabase Auth settings."]

### Schema Changes

- [e.g., "Added `avatar_url TEXT` column to `profiles` table via SQL Editor:"]

```sql
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN avatar_url TEXT;
```

- [e.g., "Added foreign key constraint:"]

```sql
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD CONSTRAINT profiles_id_fkey
FOREIGN KEY (id) REFERENCES auth.users (id) ON DELETE CASCADE;
```

### RLS Policy Changes

- [e.g., "Created RLS policy for updating profiles:"]

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to update their own profile"
ON public.profiles FOR UPDATE
USING (auth.uid() = id);
```

### Trigger/Function Changes

- [e.g., "Created and enabled user creation trigger:"]

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user()
RETURNS trigger AS $$
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO public.profiles (id, username)
  VALUES (new.id, new.email);
  RETURN new;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

CREATE TRIGGER on_auth_user_created
  AFTER INSERT ON auth.users
  FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE public.handle_new_user();
```

### SMTP Configuration

- [e.g., "Configured Supabase SMTP settings with Mailtrap credentials."]

## Consistency Verification

[Confirmation that Supabase configuration now aligns exactly with the "Needs to Be" standard]

## Test Results

### RLS Policy Tests

[Screenshots or SQL output showing RLS policy tests]

```sql
-- Example test output
set role authenticated;
set auth.uid() = '1a2b3c4d-5e6f-7g8h-9i0j-1k2l3m4n5o6p';  -- pragma: allowlist secret
SELECT * FROM profiles;
-- Shows only the authenticated user's profile

set auth.uid() = 'different-user-id';
SELECT * FROM profiles WHERE id = '1a2b3c4d-5e6f-7g8h-9i0j-1k2l3m4n5o6p';  -- pragma: allowlist secret
-- Returns no rows (policy working correctly)
```

### Trigger Tests

[Evidence that user creation trigger works]

- [e.g., "Created a new user in Supabase Auth UI and verified a profile row was automatically created"]

### Schema Verification

[SQL output showing final schema]

```sql
\d profiles
-- Shows complete table structure with all columns and constraints
```

### SMTP Verification

[Screenshot showing configured SMTP settings]

- [Note: Full email flow will be tested in Phase 6]

## Conclusion

Supabase configuration for user management has been verified, corrected, and aligns consistently with the defined standard. The database layer is correctly set up for the application.

### Next Steps

Proceed to Phase 4 to verify the backend (NestJS) implementation.
