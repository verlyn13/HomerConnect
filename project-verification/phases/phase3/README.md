# Phase 3: Supabase Configuration Verification

## Objective

Verify that the Supabase project's configuration (Auth, Database Schema, RLS, Triggers) for user management is correct and consistent with the application's requirements and best practices.

## Key Questions to Answer

- **Q3.1: Auth Settings:** How should Supabase Authentication be configured? (Email/Password enabled, Email Confirmation required, security settings)
- **Q3.2: Database Schema:** What database table(s) and schema are required for user profiles and their data?
- **Q3.3: Row Level Security (RLS):** What RLS policies are required on profile/user data tables?
- **Q3.4: Triggers/Functions:** Are any database triggers or functions required for user management?
- **Q3.5: SMTP Configuration:** How should Supabase be configured for sending authentication emails (using Mailtrap for testing)?

## Required Deliverables for Mastery

- [ ] Written answers to the 5 "Key Questions" (included in the report)
- [ ] Evidence of the initial Supabase configuration state (screenshots, SQL output)
- [ ] A list or SQL output of the specific changes made in Supabase
- [ ] Evidence of the final Supabase configuration state (updated screenshots, SQL output)
- [ ] Evidence of RLS policy testing (Policy editor test results, SQL Editor output)
- [ ] Completed "Phase 3 Report (Supabase Verification)" documenting your findings and fixes

## Approach

1. First, define your standards by answering the Key Questions
2. Navigate through the Supabase dashboard to inventory the current state:
   - Authentication settings
   - Table Editor/SQL Editor for schema
   - RLS policies
   - Database Functions
   - Project Settings -> Auth -> SMTP
3. Compare the current state to your defined standards
4. Identify discrepancies and inconsistencies
5. Apply necessary changes through the Supabase dashboard or SQL Editor
6. Verify changes through testing
7. Document findings and fixes in the Phase 3 Report

## Success Criteria

- Supabase is configured exactly as defined in the "Needs to Be" standards
- RLS tests prove policies work as intended
- The Phase 3 Report accurately reflects before/after states, justifies changes, documents findings, and summarizes test results

## Next Steps

After completing Phase 3, proceed to [Phase 4: Backend (NestJS) Implementation Verification](../phase4/README.md)
