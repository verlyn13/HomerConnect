# Email System Implementation

I've implemented a comprehensive email system following the plan in `email-plan.md`. The system is now set up to use:

- **Mailtrap** for development/testing
- **Postmark** for production

## Changes Made

1. **Environment Configuration**
   - Created `.env.development` with Mailtrap settings
   - Created `.env.production` with Postmark settings
   - Updated main `.env` with development defaults

2. **Supabase Auth Email Configuration**
   - Updated `supabase/config.toml` to use environment variables for SMTP settings
   - Set sender email to `hello@homer-events.org` and sender name to "Homer Calendar"

3. **Backend Email Integration**
   - Created NestJS mail module with environment-based configuration
   - Added mail service with test and RSVP confirmation methods
   - Created email templates with responsive HTML designs
   - Added test endpoint to send emails from the backend

4. **Frontend Email Integration**
   - Implemented server action for sending emails from Next.js
   - Enhanced API test page with email testing functionality
   - Added Supabase auth email testing to the same page

## How to Test

1. **Set up email providers**:
   - For development: Create a Mailtrap account and update credentials in `.env`
   - For production: Create a Postmark account and set up sender signature

2. **Test email functionality**:
   - Visit `/api-test` to test both Next.js and Supabase emails
   - Use password reset flow to test Supabase auth emails
   - Test backend emails via API endpoint: `POST /send-test-email/{email}`

## Next Steps

1. **Customize Email Templates**:
   - Add the company logo
   - Update colors to match brand
   - Create templates for all types of notifications

2. **Email Analytics**:
   - Set up webhook endpoints to track email delivery
   - Implement bounce tracking and handling

3. **Domain Setup**:
   - Configure SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records for production
   - Verify sender domain in Postmark
